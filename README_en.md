## 🧠 Suggestions

### 1. How to do better
> **Capture the "What if" moments**

While completing the basic requirements, you will often observe counter-intuitive phenomena or have some "what if" hypotheses.
*   **Seize this thought** and conduct some extra experiments. It is both interesting and helpful for getting high scores.
*   If you have no specific ideas, try simple **parameter comparisons** or **ablation studies**.

### 2. How to write the Report
> **Be straightforward and lower the reading barrier**

The core principle of a report is: **Make it effortless for the reader to understand your work and conclusions.**

Avoid being overly complex or messy. Just present your charts and analysis objectively and clearly.

*   💡 You might want to refer to my C++ repository for style reference: [SUSTech-CPP-Project](https://github.com/BrightonXX/SUSTech-CPP-Project)
